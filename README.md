## Project Aim <p>
This project aims to enhance risk assessment for financial institutions by predicting the likelihood of loan defaults. By identifying high-risk clients, banks can make informed decisions, reduce financial losses, and improve lending processes. The project involves data exploration, preparation, model training, and interpretation to provide reliable insights into loan default probabilities.

This repository contains several folders:
-
  - **``data``**: contains datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models. (empty, files too heavy)
  -  **``docs``**: includes documentation related to the project, such as user guides, API documentation, and reports (empty).
  -  **``env``**: holds environment settings or configurations. It contains the file requirements.txt where you can find the packages and their corresponding versions.
  -  **``html``**: contains HTML files of the .ipynb files.
  -  **``images``**: stores image files used in the project.
  -  **``models``**: contains trained machine learning models.
  -  **``notebooks``**: includes Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model training.
  -  **``src``**: contains the source code for the project, a .py file with functions that are used.
  -  **``README``**: provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to set up and run it.

The notebooks you can find in this repository are the following ones:
-
- **01_General_exploration.ipynb**:this notebook contains a general exploration of the dataset, including initial visualizations, descriptive statistics, and a preliminary analysis to better understand the data.
- **02_Correlations_missing_outliers.ipynb**: this notebook analyzes the correlations between variables, identifies and handles missing values, and detects and manages outliers. This preparation is crucial before training the models.
- **03_Encoding_scaling_modelselection.ipynb**: this notebook is dedicated to encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and model selection. It includes techniques for preparing the data for modeling and comparing different machine learning algorithms to choose the best one.
